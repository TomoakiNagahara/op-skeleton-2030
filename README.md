# üôè Apology

Sorry, let me offer a few apologies in advance.

## üìò About English

We do not focus on perfect or strict English grammar.

In addition to the United Kingdom, countries such as the United States and Australia also use English as an official language.
Furthermore, there are countries like India, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines where English is used as a common language.
However, this does not focus on the English of any specific country.

We are not native speakers, so as long as the meaning gets across, it's good enough.

## üåç UTF-8 Only

Officially, only UTF-8 is supported.
However, other encodings may also work, depending on PHP‚Äôs specifications.

## ‚ùå Microsoft Windows Products Not Supported

We do not officially support Microsoft Windows products.
This is to maintain clean and consistent source code.
However, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) will likely work.
